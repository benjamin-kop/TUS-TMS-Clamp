In this repository you will find .stl and .easm (eDrawing) files for our TUS-TMS clamp. The files provided are designed for use with 2-element annular array transducers with solid water coupling (CTX-500-2CH/CTX-250-2CH) manufactured by Sonic Concepts Inc. (Bothell, WA, USA) and supplied/supported by Brainbox Ltd. (Cardiff, UK). The clamp has been designed specifically for the MagVenture MC-B70 coil (Farum, Denmark). Credits to Norbert Hermesdorf of our technical support group for designing these models. 

These files may be adapted for use in other labs. 
- Complete Model (incl TMS).easm: an eDrawing file including each component of the TUS-TMS clamp in addition to an ultrasound transducer and TMS coil model. 
- clamp.stl: the front-end of the clamp that grips the ultrasound transducer.
- topHook.stl: the hook at the top of the clamp to help secure it to the TMS coil. 
- bottomRing.stl: the second half of the ring at the bottom of the clamp that fastening around the TMS rod.
